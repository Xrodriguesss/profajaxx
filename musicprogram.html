    <strong>Letra</strong>
    <p>
        It starts with one<br>
        All I know<br>
        It's so unreal<br>
        Watch you go<br>
        I tried so har<br>
        But in the end<br>
        I had to fall <br>
        But in the end<br>
        One thing, I d<br>
        <br>
        It doesn't even matter how hard you tr<br>
        Keep that in mind, I designed this rhy<br>
        To remind myself of a time when I trie<br>
        In spite of the way you were mockin' m<br>
        Actin' like I was part of your propert<br>
        Remembering all the times you fought w<br>
        <br>
        I'm surprised it got so far<br>
        Things aren't the way they <br>
        You wouldn't even recognize<br>
        Not that you knew me back t<br>
        But it all comes back to me<br>
        You kept everything inside<br>
        And even though I tried, it<br>
        What it meant to me will ev<br>
        Be a memory of a time when <br>
        I tried so hard and got so <br>
        But in the end, it doesn't <br>
        <br>
        I had to fall to lose it all<br>
        But in the end, it doesn't e<br>
        One thing, I don't know why<br>
        It doesn't even matter how h<br>
        Keep that in mind<br>
        I designed this rhyme to exp<br>
        All I know<br>
        <br>
        Time is a valuable thing<br>
        Watch it fly by as the pendu<br>
        Watch it count down to the e<br>
        The clock ticks life away<br>
        It's so unreal<br>
        <br>
        You didn't look out below<br>
        Watch the time go right out <br>
        Tryin' to hold on, they didn't even know<br>
        I wasted it all just to watch you go<br>
        I kept everything inside<br>
        And even though I tried, it all fell apa<br>
        What it meant to me will eventually be a<br>
        Of a time when I tried so hard<br>
        </p>
